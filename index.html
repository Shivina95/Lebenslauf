        <p>Hello and welcome to my website! Here is a short bio. I am Indian by birth, and reside in Germany. Growing up, I had the dream of becoming an astronaut üöÄ. However, that dream was crushed when I got glasses ü§ì. Although I began my career as an Engineer my love for programming üíª led me to choosing it as my next step. I am an avid reader üìò and like to indulge in witty conversations with people I meet. I live my life by the principle that, When we truly wish for something, we get it, and if we don't, it only means life has a bigger plan for us. So here's to optimism ü•Ç</p>

material microstructure.</li>
<li>Preparation of the post-processed data to perform multiscale simulations. The simulations were performed in
LINUX environment on a high performance cluster.</li>
<li>The validation of the
simulation results led to a better understanding of the
of the material behavior. </li>
<li>Development of a Python routine for the detection of cracks
in the fibers using the libraries numpy,
pandas, matplotlib and scikit-image. In addition, functions were implemented to
support this process.</li>
